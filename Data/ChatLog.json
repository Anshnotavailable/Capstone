In lower classes, gravity is taught as a force because it's a simplification that helps students understand the concept of gravity in a more intuitive way. The force-based approach is a good approximation for many everyday situations, and it's easier to understand and work with than the more complex curvature of spacetime concept. It's not until higher-level physics classes, like those that cover relativity, that the more nuanced understanding of gravity as a curvature of spacetime is introduced."
