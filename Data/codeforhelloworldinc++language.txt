Dear Lenovo,

I hope this letter finds you well. As per your request, I am writing to provide you with the code for "Hello World" in C++ language.

Here is the simple code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To explain this code, we start by including the iostream library, which allows us to perform input/output operations. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. Inside `main()`, we use `std::cout` to print "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by `std::endl` to insert a newline character. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

You can save this code in a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `hello.cpp`) and compile it using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`). Running the resulting executable will display "Hello, World!" on the screen.

I hope this helps you get started with C++ programming. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
